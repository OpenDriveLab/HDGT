## Introduction

HDGT is an unified heterogeneous transformer-based graph neural network for driving scene encoding. It is a **SOTA method** on [INTERACTION](http://challenge.interaction-dataset.com/leader-board) and [Waymo](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/2021/motion-prediction/) Motion Prediction Chanllege.

By time of release in April 2022, the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art on INTERACTION Prediction Challenge and Waymo Open Motion Challenge, in which we rank the **first** and **second** respectively in terms of the minADE/minFDE metric.
